##Flash Card Program
Is a revision tool I made when tutoring a student over the lockdown. Allows you to add questions by topic and then test yourself. You can also ask for hints for the answer. It was made using SQL and Python.

##WhatsApp Birthday Bot
A bot which sends me WhatsApp messages whenever it is someones birthday. It also allows you to communicate with it ask query specific people's birthdays.
It sends a message every morning at 9:30 am saying whether it is someones birthday or not.
I made it using Python, Firebase and Heroku.
