# PortfolioProjects
Here is the repository for various projects I have completed over the past years.

FlashCardProgram.py:
This is a program I made when tutoring a student to demonstrate GUI's and databases (SQL).

VERSION1.py:
This is a graphing calculator that I made for my coursework in year 13.
It demonstrated the use of GUI's but is quite inefficient in the code. I will come back to this and modify it.

Polimoad:
This is a fashion webiste I developed for a client.
I have removed the database connection for security reasons but the official link is here: https://arkx-store.com/HomePage/*
This project was made using React, Bootstrap and Firebase.

Whatsapp Bot:
Using Twilio, Heroku and Firebase I built a whatsapp bot which sends me birthday reminders at 9:30 am.
Again, i have removed the database connection.


Source code to other projects will be made available soon.
